This page covers the Google Meet specifics: how to extract IDs, what to expect during admission, and common failure modes.

## Native meeting ID

Use the meeting code from the URL:

- URL: `https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij`
- `native_meeting_id`: `abc-defg-hij`

## Admission model

Most Google Meet meetings require the host to admit the bot from the waiting room.

Typical lifecycle:

1. Bot joins and waits in the lobby (`awaiting_admission`)
2. Host admits the bot
3. Bot becomes `active`

If the bot is never admitted, you will not get a meaningful transcript or recording.

## API example

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/bots" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "platform": "google_meet",
    "native_meeting_id": "abc-defg-hij",
    "recording_enabled": true,
    "transcribe_enabled": true,
    "transcription_tier": "realtime"
  }'
```

## Common issues

### Bot joins then leaves quickly

Most often:

- the bot was not admitted
- the meeting is over / invalid link
- policy restrictions on the meeting (host settings)

Check the meeting status history and bot logs, and confirm the host admits the bot.

### No transcript segments

Common causes:

- `transcribe_enabled=false`
- the meeting was silent (or audio capture failed)
