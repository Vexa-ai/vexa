Meetings are created/updated as bots run. You can list history, attach metadata (notes), and delete/anonymize artifacts.

## GET /meetings

## DELETE `/meetings/{platform}/{native_meeting_id}`

Delete transcript data and recording artifacts (best-effort) and anonymize the meeting.

Important semantics:

- Only works for finalized meetings (`completed` or `failed`).
- Safe to retry: calling delete multiple times returns success; repeated calls are a no-op after the meeting is already anonymized.
- The meeting record remains for telemetry/usage tracking (with PII scrubbed).
- After deletion, the original `native_meeting_id` is cleared, so you cannot retry by `/{platform}/{native_meeting_id}` later.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Google Meet">
```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  "$API_BASE/meetings/google_meet/abc-defg-hij"
```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Microsoft Teams">
```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  "$API_BASE/meetings/teams/1234567890123"
```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Zoom">
```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  "$API_BASE/meetings/zoom/12345678901"
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

If you want to delete just recordings (and keep transcript data), use:

- `DELETE /recordings/{recording_id}` (see [Recordings API](recordings))

Returns a human-readable confirmation message. This operation is safe to retry (idempotent): deleting an already-anonymized meeting returns success.

  "message": "Meeting google_meet/abc-defg-hij transcripts and recording artifacts deleted; meeting data anonymized"
