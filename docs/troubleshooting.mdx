This page covers the most common production and self-hosted issues.

## Bot issues

### Bot joins then leaves quickly

Common causes:

- not admitted (Google Meet waiting room)
- wrong meeting ID / passcode (Teams)
- Zoom not configured (missing OAuth/OBF token path or Meeting SDK credentials)
- meeting ended / link invalid

What to do:

1. Check meeting status history in your UI (or your logs).
2. Confirm you used the correct `native_meeting_id` for the platform.
3. For Meet/Teams: confirm a host admits the bot.
4. For Zoom: confirm [`zoom-app-setup.md`](zoom-app-setup) is fully configured.

## Transcript issues

### No transcript segments

Common causes:

- `transcribe_enabled=false`
- there was no speech (silence)
- audio capture failed (platform/browser restrictions)

Verify:

- call `GET /transcripts/{platform}/{native_meeting_id}` and check `segments`
- check bot logs for capture/transcription errors

## Recording / playback issues

### "No audio recording" (post-meeting)

Common causes:

- `recording_enabled=false` for that meeting
- storage backend misconfigured (object store credentials/bucket)
- recording is still finalizing (short delay after stop)

What to do:

1. Call `GET /transcripts/{platform}/{native_meeting_id}` and check if `recordings` exists.
2. If recordings exist, stream audio via:
   - `GET /recordings/{recording_id}/media/{media_file_id}/raw`
3. Validate storage configuration:
   - [`recording-storage.md`](recording-storage)

### Browser playback can't seek

Seeking requires `Range` support (`206 Partial Content`).

If you proxy audio through a frontend, ensure your proxy forwards the `Range` header and returns the raw bytes without JSON parsing.

## Bot lifecycle issues

### Bot stuck in "waiting for admission" after failure

If the bot container dies while waiting for admission, the bot record may remain in `waiting_for_admission` state. This blocks retries for the same meeting.

Workaround: delete the meeting via `DELETE /meetings/{platform}/{native_meeting_id}` and retry. ([#113](https://github.com/Vexa-ai/vexa/issues/113))

## API / Admin issues

### Swagger UI shows wrong auth header

The auto-generated curl examples in `http://localhost:8056/docs` use `X-API-Key` instead of the correct `X-Admin-API-Key` header for admin endpoints. Copy the curl command but replace the header manually. ([#80](https://github.com/Vexa-ai/vexa/issues/80), [#62](https://github.com/Vexa-ai/vexa/issues/62))

### No option to disable real-time transcription

Currently there is no way to have a bot join a meeting for audio recording only without also generating a transcript. If you only need the raw recording, transcription will still run. ([#70](https://github.com/Vexa-ai/vexa/issues/70))

## Delete / retention issues

### Deleted meetings still appear

Vexa anonymizes deleted meetings for telemetry/usage tracking. UIs should hide deleted meetings from default lists.

API semantics:
