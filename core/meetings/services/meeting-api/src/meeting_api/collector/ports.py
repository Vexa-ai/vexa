"""Ports (Protocols) — the seams that let the SAME ``create_app`` / ``ingest`` run with real
adapters in production and injected fakes in tests.

The deployed transcription-collector (``services/meeting-api/meeting_api/collector/``) talks to
two collaborators:

  * **Postgres / Redis** as the transcript store — the meeting record (``meeting.data`` JSONB +
    transcript segments) is read for ``GET /transcripts`` / ``GET /meetings`` and authorized for
    ``POST /ws/authorize-subscribe`` (``collector/endpoints.py``); the segment-ingestion worker
    appends new segments (``collector/processors.py``).
  * **Redis** as the bus — the worker XREADGROUPs the ``transcription_segments`` stream
    (``collector/consumer.py``) and PUBLISHes change-only updates to
    ``tc:meeting:{id}:mutable`` (``services/redis.md`` — the pubsub the gateway ``/ws`` fans in).

Each collaborator is a ``typing.Protocol`` so the app depends on BEHAVIOR, not a concrete client.
``adapters.py`` supplies the production implementations (SQLAlchemy/redis-asyncio); the eval +
conformance harness supply in-process fakes (an in-memory store + fakeredis). Both satisfy these
Protocols structurally — no inheritance required.
