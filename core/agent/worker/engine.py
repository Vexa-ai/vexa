"""engine.py — the GENERIC turn engine of the in-container agent harness.

Runs INSIDE a runtime-spawned, ISOLATED container (agents never run in the control plane). It reads
its dispatch from env — the mounted workspace, the minted token, ``REDIS_URL`` + the ``unit:<id>:in/out``
Stream topics, the ``start`` — runs the agent turn over the mounted ``/workspace`` via the
provider-agnostic ``llm`` ports (the HARNESS adapter is selected by ``VEXA_RUNNER``; this module
never names a vendor), and ``XADD``s each UnitEvent to its output Stream. Then it blocks on the
input Stream for the next message (chat continuity) until idle — TTL-on-idle by the harness.
Continuity is the **session file** in the workspace, so a reaped+respawned container resumes
instantly.

The redis loop is factored into ``serve()`` with the turn-runner INJECTED, and the harness itself
resolves through the ``worker.worker.harness_factory`` seam, so everything is offline-provable with
a fake redis + a fake harness (no docker, no CLI, no provider).

This module holds the GENERIC engine; the MEETING copilot lives in ``worker.meeting``. ``worker.worker``
re-exports both so existing ``from worker.worker import X`` imports keep resolving.
