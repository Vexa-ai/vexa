# Stream: Services / Database

You are part of a parallel development system.

If session is named `stream-services`, your brief is at:
`/Users/dmitriygrankin/dev/plan/services/stream.md`

If session is named `stream-database`, your brief is at:
`/Users/dmitriygrankin/dev/plan/database/stream.md`

Read your brief on session start. Read any context files listed in "Shared context".

## Rules
- Do the TODOs in your stream file
- Update your stream file as you work (check off items, add status)
- If you produce something another stream needs → write in "Notes for Master"
- If blocked → write what you need in "Blocked" section → stop
- NEVER read/write other stream files or context/ files (master handles that)
