title: "Security and Data Handling"
---
This page documents the security boundaries and data lifecycle at a high level for self-hosted and hosted deployments.

## Authentication and Secrets

- All API calls use `X-API-Key`.
- Admin operations use `ADMIN_API_TOKEN` (self-hosted).

Rules:

- Never commit API keys, admin tokens, OAuth credentials, or object-storage secrets.
- Rotate any credential immediately if it is exposed.

## What Data Is Stored

Depending on configuration and per-meeting flags, Vexa may store:

- meeting metadata (platform, native meeting ID, timestamps)
- transcript segments (text + timing + speaker attribution)
- recording artifacts (audio media files) when `recording_enabled=true`

## Storage Backends

Recommended for production:

- Keep compute stateless.
- Store artifacts in S3-compatible object storage (`STORAGE_BACKEND=s3`).

Testing only:

- `STORAGE_BACKEND=local` (requires mounted volume for persistence)

Details:

- [`recording-storage.md`](recording-storage)

## Deletion Semantics

Deleting a meeting is intended to purge transcript/recording artifacts best-effort, then anonymize the meeting record (for usage tracking/telemetry).

This means:

- the meeting may remain in storage in anonymized form
- artifacts should be removed from your configured storage backend

## Zoom Credentials Caveat

Zoom integrations involve sensitive credentials (OAuth + SDK secrets). Follow:

- [`zoom-app-setup.md`](zoom-app-setup)
