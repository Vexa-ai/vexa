Zoom bots require additional configuration (Zoom OAuth + Meeting SDK + OBF token flow) and typically Marketplace approval to reliably join meetings across users.

## Native meeting ID and passcode

For Zoom, you must pass the numeric meeting ID:

- URL: `https://us05web.zoom.us/j/89055866087?pwd=...`
- `native_meeting_id`: `89055866087`

If your URL includes `?pwd=...`, you may pass it as `passcode`:

```json
{
  "platform": "zoom",
  "native_meeting_id": "89055866087",
  "passcode": "YOUR_PWD"
}
```

## Approval caveat (important)

Marketplace approval can take weeks to months. Before approval, you should assume you can reliably join only meetings created/hosted by the authorizing account.

The hosted Vexa service Zoom app is not approved at the time of writing, so hosted Zoom bots should be treated as limited until approval is complete.

## Setup guide

Use this guide for the exact OAuth + OBF flow and environment variables:

## API example

```bash
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/bots" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "platform": "zoom",
    "native_meeting_id": "YOUR_MEETING_ID",
    "passcode": "YOUR_PWD",
    "recording_enabled": true,
    "transcribe_enabled": true,
    "transcription_tier": "realtime"
  }'
```
