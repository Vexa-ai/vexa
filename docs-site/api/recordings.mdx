# Recordings API

Recordings are created only if recording is enabled **and** audio capture succeeds.

If a recording exists, it will also be returned by:

- `GET /transcripts/{platform}/{native_meeting_id}` → `recordings[]`

## GET /recordings

List recordings for the authenticated user.

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  "$API_BASE/recordings?limit=50&offset=0"
```

## GET /recordings/{recording_id}

Get a recording and its `media_files`.

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  "$API_BASE/recordings/123456789"
```

## DELETE /recordings/{recording_id}

Delete a recording, its media files from storage, and related DB rows (best-effort storage cleanup).

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  "$API_BASE/recordings/123456789"
```

## GET /recordings/{recording_id}/media/{media_file_id}/raw

Authenticated byte streaming (best for browser playback via same-origin proxy).

- Returns `Content-Disposition: inline`
- Supports `Range` requests (`206`) for seeking in `<audio>`

```bash
curl -L \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  "$API_BASE/recordings/123456789/media/987654321/raw" \
  -o audio.wav
```

## GET /recordings/{recording_id}/media/{media_file_id}/download

Returns a presigned URL for object storage backends (S3 / MinIO compatible).

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  "$API_BASE/recordings/123456789/media/987654321/download"
```
