# Meetings API

Meetings are created/updated as bots run. You can list history, attach metadata (notes), and delete/anonymize artifacts.

## GET /meetings

List meetings for the authenticated user.

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  "$API_BASE/meetings"
```

## PATCH /meetings/{platform}/{native_meeting_id}

Update meeting metadata (stored in `meeting.data`), commonly used for:

- `name`
- `participants`
- `languages`
- `notes`

## DELETE /meetings/{platform}/{native_meeting_id}

Delete transcript data and recording artifacts (best-effort) and anonymize the meeting.

Important semantics:

- Only works for finalized meetings (`completed` or `failed`).
- Deletion is **idempotent** (already-redacted meetings return success).
- The meeting record remains for telemetry/usage tracking (with PII scrubbed).
- After deletion, the original `native_meeting_id` is cleared, so you cannot retry by `{platform}/{native_meeting_id}` later.

curl -X DELETE \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  "$API_BASE/meetings/google_meet/abc-defg-hij"
```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Microsoft Teams">
```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  "$API_BASE/meetings/teams/9321836506982"
```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Zoom">
```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  "$API_BASE/meetings/zoom/89055866087"
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

If you want to delete just recordings (and keep transcript data), use:

- `DELETE /recordings/{recording_id}` (see [`docs/api/recordings.md`](recordings.md))
