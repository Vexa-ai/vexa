Vexa is an open-source meeting bot + API for real-time transcription and post-meeting playback.

If you're here, you likely want one of three things:

- **Get transcripts via API** (fastest path)
- **Self-host Vexa** (recommended for production)
- **Use the dashboard** (join meetings, review history, play recordings)

## Pick Your Path

### 1) Fastest: Hosted API

1. Get an API key: https://vexa.ai/dashboard/api-keys
2. Send a bot to a meeting: [`POST /bots`](user_api_guide.md)
3. Read transcripts: [`GET /transcripts/{platform}/{native_meeting_id}`](user_api_guide.md)

For low-latency live streaming, use WebSockets:

- [WebSocket guide](websocket.md)

### 2) Production Self-Host (Vexa Lite)

Vexa Lite is a single container that connects to:

- your Postgres database
- your remote transcription service

Start here:

- [Vexa Lite deployment](vexa-lite-deployment.md)

### 3) Local Development (Docker Compose)

For contributors and local testing:

- [Docker Compose (dev) deployment](deployment.md)

### 4) Dashboard UI (Playback)

If you want a UI to join meetings and review history (including playback when recordings exist):

- [Dashboard UI](ui-dashboard.md)

## Concepts That Matter

- [Meeting links & IDs](meeting-ids.md): what to pass as `native_meeting_id` (and when `passcode` is required)
- [Core concepts](concepts.md): bot/meeting/session model + timing semantics
- [Recording storage](recording-storage.md): how artifacts are stored + playback notes (`Range`/`206`)
- [Delete semantics](concepts.md#delete-semantics): what “delete” means and what remains for telemetry

## Zoom (The Only Special Platform)

Zoom has extra constraints (OAuth + Meeting SDK + OBF token flow) and typically Marketplace approval.

- [Zoom limitations](platforms/zoom.md)
- [Zoom app setup](zoom-app-setup.md)
