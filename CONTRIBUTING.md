# Contributing to Vexa

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Vexa!

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Vexa enforces the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) on all contributions. The DCO is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing.

### DCO Process

Contributors sign-off that they adhere to the DCO by adding a Signed-off-by line to commit messages:

```
Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com>
```

You can add this automatically to your commit message by using `git commit -s`.

### DCO Content

By signing off, you are agreeing to the following:

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all

    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
